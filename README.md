Distributed Password Cracker

Implemented a Client-Server system using the socket programming libraries of C++ to design a server that maximizes the efficiency of cracking an incoming stream of passwords by optimally distributing the tasks to the worker machines. This work was done as part of the Computer Networks (CS 224) course at IIT Bombay in Spring 2016.
